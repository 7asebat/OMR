## How to retrain models

You can retrain the models by simply adding the trainers and datasets inside the project folder and running each trainer separately and it will train the model.

## Which datasets did we use

We used a scanned generated dataset that we created ourselves using `guido-editor`, `javascript`, and `python`.
It is a large dataset and only a small revised portion of it was used for the training, however for some models we included a larger portion to allow for better accuracy.

## How much time does training take

No more than a few seconds for all models, the features are not time consuming and the dataset is not that big.

## Which hardware was used for training

Models were trained on an i5-9300H with 16GB ram using Python.
